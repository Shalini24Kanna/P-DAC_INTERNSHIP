## 1.Purpose of Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)
In real world, most of the data available is in the form of analog in nature. We have two types of converters analog to digital converter and digital to analog converter. These two converting interfaces are essential to obtain the required operations of a processor to manipulate the data of digital electronic equipment and an analog electric equipment. 
Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) is a device that transforms digital data into an analog signal in order to interact with the real world. The digital signal is represented with a binary code, which is a combination of bits 0’s and 1’s. The digital data can be produced from a microprocessor, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), or Application Specified Integrated Circuit (ASIC). There are two commonly used DAC conversions – Weighed resistors method and R-2R ladder network method. 
Applications of a DAC: audio amplifier, video encoder, display electronics, data acquisition systems, calibration, Digital potentiometer.

## 3.EDA tools used to implement Potentiometric DAC
The design has been built using open-source EDA tools. The library used is sky130.
This design is implemented using [xschem](https://xschem.sourceforge.io/stefan/index.html), and [ngspice](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/download.html) is used to run the simulations & verify the circuitry. For circuit layout implementation, [Magic](http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/) will be used. 
The step to install xschem with sky130 and ngspice can be found [here](https://github.com/bluecmd/learn-sky130/blob/main/schematic/xschem/getting-started.md#installation-of-xschem).

## 4.New_Implementation of 10Bit DAC

This project is design of 10-bit Potentiometric DAC with Sky-130 PDK
The novel design for 10bit DAC with reduced number of resistors and switches is proposed. 
The conventional DAC has 1024 resistors, but the proposed DAC requires only 94 resistors.
The conventional DAC has 1024 swithces, but the proposed DAC requires only 96 switches.
For whole design, we will use 1172 transistors. 
So, the proposed design could be an efficient alternative for Higher bit DACs and this 10-Bit Potentiometric implementation designs can be found [here](https://github.com/deepsita/P-DAC_INTERNSHIP/tree/main/ProjectDesigns).

The complete design of the proposed DAC is given in the [proposed_dac.pdf](https://github.com/deepsita/P-DAC_INTERNSHIP/blob/main/proposed_dac.pdf).

The challenge in this DAC design was to obtain the required voltage level. The practical implementation and simulation resulted in lower voltage levels.

## 5.Conventional Implementation of 10Bit Potentiometeric DAC
The basic idea is to divide the voltage into N different voltage values in the range of VREFH and VREFL- for an N-Bit DAC. The design used here to achieve this is the simple resistor string DAC which consists of resistors in series. These resistors are then connected to various switches in such a fashion that it routes the exact voltage to the output. The problem of the largeness of the circuit is reduced by building hierarchical subcircuits of 10-Bit potentiometric DAC – Switch, 2-bit, 3-bit, 4-bit, 5-bit, 6-bit, 7-bit, 8-bit, 9-bit and 10-bit.
