# P-DAC_INTERNSHIP
This project is design of 10-bit Potentiometric DAC with Sky-130 PDK
The novel design for 10bit DAC with reduced number of resistors and switches is proposed. 
The conventional DAC has 1024 resistors, but the proposed DAC requires only 94 resistors. 
However, the FSV is same  as the conventional DAC.
