## P-DAC_INTERNSHIP
This project is design of 10-bit Potentiometric DAC with Sky-130 PDK
The novel design for 10bit DAC with reduced number of resistors and switches is proposed. 
The conventional DAC has 1024 resistors, but the proposed DAC requires only 94 resistors.
The conventional DAC has 1024 seithces, but the proposed DAC requires only 96 switches.
For whole design, we will use 1172 transistors. 
However, the FSV is same  as the conventional DAC.
So, the proposed design could be an efficient alternative for Higher bit DACs.

The complete design of the proposed DAC is given in the proposed_dac.pdf
